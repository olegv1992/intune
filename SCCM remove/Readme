I had some devices not migrated to Intune from SCCM for Co-Management, there was Compliance status "See ConfigMgr" 
Workloads not transferred into Intune, devices are scattered all over the world, so decided to push some fixes from intune. 
Tried Remediation Scripts and it works:
# SCCM_Detection.ps1 - detection of intalled SCCM client
# SCCM_Remediate.ps1 - main install script
It uninstall sccm using setup file and key "/uninstall",  removes CCM folders, registry keys and WMIs, set registry for autoenroll using USER CREDENTIALS, runs deviceenroller actions

Deploy remediation to needed group * WARNING! Do it step by step, do not assing to all! *
