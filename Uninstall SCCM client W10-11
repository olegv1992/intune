I had some devices not migrated to Intune from SCCM for Co-Management, there was Compliance status "See ConfigMgr" 
Workloads not transferred into Intune, devices are scattered all over the world, so decided to push some fixes from intune. 
Tried Remediation Scripts, but "Ccmsetup /uninstall" not cleaning all the trash. CCMclean.exe( https://www.anoopcnair.com/sccm-client-uninstall-remove-using-ccmclean-exe/)  does it better, but I can't push it via Remediation (you can try Invoke-WebRequest to download file and work with it in remediation - I don't want such practise)
I decided to create intunewin file, where placed install script, detection script and ccmclean.exe and deploy it via intune. 
Here is my code
